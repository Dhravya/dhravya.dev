When I got started with programming, everywhere I went, I saw (good), but paid services. I would see them and say to myself ‚ÄúI really want to buy that when I get the money... It will help a lot‚Äù... And then, I came to know about Github‚Äôs student developer pack. But.... I got rejected... 15 times....

If you‚Äôre a student, this is for you

## The benefits

I‚Äôll only list the stuff I extensively use, and have become a part of my lifestyle now

- Canva premium for a year
- Educative pro for 6 months
- Namecheap, .tech, [name.com](http://name.com) domains
- Github PRO (I don‚Äôt know what extra stuff I get but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm using all of them loll)
- Gitlens+ (Very useful)
- Termius pro
- Replit hacker plan for 3 months
- Stripe waived transaction fees
- Browerstack for testing and stuff (really good for compatibility tests too)

Now that‚Äôs really good considering that all that is for FREE! For me, I use Educative the most, and there‚Äôs a lot more stuff that isn‚Äôt much useful for me but you might like

- Jetbrains IDE
- Bootstrap studio
- Azure, DigitalOcean credits
- Productivity tools like Dashlane premium, Pomodone and HazeOver

Damn

## How to get the pack

It‚Äôs pretty easy, just go to [education.github.com/pack](http://education.github.com/pack) and hit this button

Then you‚Äôll be asked to give your email, school name, etc. Fill those in, and finally you‚Äôll be asked to submit any document to prove that you‚Äôre a student. The only requirements are

- Should have your name (and preferably photo)
- Should have school name
- Should have the date of the academic year

ID cards are perfect for this.

Well, it‚Äôs supposed to be that easy. But clearly it wasn‚Äôt so easy for me...

## My story (struggle)

So after I came to know about the students pack, I was actually shocked, and tried to apply immediately. However, I had just passed my 10th grade months ago, and I hadn‚Äôt received the ID card for my 11th grade, and since everything was online, I had nothing to show. So I just started with the proofs I had in 10th grade - ID card, report card, class photo. One by one, I submitted all of them.

I tried every day, and i think i‚Äôve kindaaa sent too many applications

I could not even contact support...

But FINALLY, I got a DM from Github education

(PS: It wasn‚Äôt as good. spoiler: Didn‚Äôt get a reply for a month)

Issue was, they never replied back! And I didn‚Äôt message too much because I knew it gets annoying for whoever is handling the account. So I did one, final tweet, and they got back to me. _sigh_

After a month of trying again and again, and even giving up for a couple weeks, I received it, finally.

So, happy ending, right? The same day, I met some ppl older than me and have already graduated, who HAD THE GITHUB PACK AND GOT IT IN THEIR FIRST TRY EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN‚ÄôT IN SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MEANWHILE ME WHO IS ACTUALLY A STUDENT HAD TO DO ALL THIS
