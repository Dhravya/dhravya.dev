Yesterday, I came across a cute cat video on discord. Bored, I thought it would be really funny if I made this into a rickroll video and forward it to my friends 😂

But you see, I'm really lazy. So lazy that instead of taking 2 minutes to edit the video, I spent the next half an hour making a python program that takes in a video and returns a rickroll (Basically, it just adds the rickroll to the end of the clip).

I had no idea about Moviepy (the package i'll be using to combine the videos), so it was a great learning experience for me and I already have one more project in which i can use the experience from rickroll generator (for the hackathon 😉)

The idea is, take a clip path and save the rickroll to a folder (say, `output.mp4`)

```py
class Rickroller:
    def make(self, clip_path:str):
        clip_path = self.__download_if_url(clip_path)
```

To maximise the amount of stuff I learn from this project, I also challenged myself to use the Rich progress bar to show the status and download videos right from URLs (which is `__download_if_url` function)

The download if url literally does nothing, checks if it's a valid URL and if yes, downloads and returns the path where it's been saved (More about `__do_download` later, which is actually downloading the stuff)

```py
    def __download_if_url(self, url: str):
        """
        Checks if it's a URL, if yes, downloads it.
        :return: None
        """
        if url.startswith("http"):
            url = self.__do_download(url)

        return url
```

Now, assuming we have the clip downloaded, I load the `clip_path` and `rickroll_path` to be actual videos i could do stuff with.

Also, I added some flexibility by allowing the users to cut some of the clip at the end (because i noticed that's what's done in these rickrolls) and finally, just concatenated the clips

```py
        clip2 = VideoFileClip(clip_path)
        clip2 = clip2.subclip(0, clip2.duration - cut_len)

        # We only want the first 15 seconds
        rickroll = rickroll.subclip(0.5, rickroll_len).resize(width=clip2.w)

        # Concatenate the two clips
        final_clip = concatenate_videoclips([clip2, rickroll], method="compose")
```

Here, I'm using `method=compose` because of a weird glitch in moviepy where it would corrupt the second clip and make a really shabby video

Also, i resize the rickroll to be as wide as the clip itself, to fix aspect ratio errors

So, here's the entire `make` function

```py
    def make(
        self,
        clip_path: str,
        output_path: str = "output.mp4",
        rickroll_path: str = "rickroll.mp4",
        rickroll_len: int = 15,
        cut_len: int = 15,
    ):
        """
        Generates the rickroll itself. Essentially just concatenates the
        video clips together.
        :param clip_path: The path to the video clip to be used.
        :param output_path: The path to the output file. Default is output.mp4
        :return: None
        """

        # Check if clip_path is a URL, if yes, downloads it and changes the clip_path
        clip_path = self.__download_if_url(clip_path)
        rickroll_path = self.__download_if_url(rickroll_path )
        rickroll = VideoFileClip(rickroll_path)

        clip2 = VideoFileClip(clip_path)
        clip2 = clip2.subclip(0, clip2.duration - cut_len)

        # We only want the first 15 seconds
        rickroll = rickroll.subclip(0.5, rickroll_len).resize(width=clip2.w)

        # Concatenate the two clips
        final_clip = concatenate_videoclips([clip2, rickroll], method="compose")

        final_clip.write_videofile(output_path)

        print(f"[bold green]Rickroll saved to {output_path}[/bold green]")
```

Yes, I've used quite a bit of `rich` module here. which you'll see now, in the section that downloads videos from URLs (which might seem normal, but making the progress bar was honestly such a pain)

## Downloading videos and saving with a progress bar

I knew 2 things:

- I have to use requests with the `stream` option set to True so i could show a progress bar and save huge videos
- I know nothing else

I checked the rich examples and realised I can customise the progress bar _a lot_

```py
        progress = Progress(
            TextColumn("[bold blue]{task.fields[filename]}", justify="right"),
            BarColumn(bar_width=None),
            "[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.1f}%",
            "•",
            DownloadColumn(),
            "•",
            TransferSpeedColumn(),
            "•",
            TimeRemainingColumn(),
        )
```

Now, each progress bar has a `taskID` assigned to it, and a context manager. I got the total length of video and then it was quite easy

```py
        with progress:

            r = requests.get(url, stream=True)

            # Getting the content length to be marked as the total length of the download
            total = int(r.headers.get("content-length"), 0)
            with open("raw.mp4", "wb") as f:
                for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
                    if chunk:
                        f.write(chunk)
                        progress.update(task_id, total=total, completed=f.tell())
```

It's done now! Can be used as a simple CLI too, which is exactly what I did

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rickroller = Rickroller()

    # Can be used as a standalone script
    rickroller.make(sys.argv[1])
```

Just because I was bored, I also made an API for generating rickrolls, but it won't be public because IMGEN and video editing are super heavy tasks which would be costly to host
