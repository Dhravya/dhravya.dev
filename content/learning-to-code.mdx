A very common question for beginners is always, ‚ÄúWhere to start‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow are you a self-taught developer at 16 years old‚Äù. I got the same question for the third time a week, and all beginners go through this.

Share your own experience down in the comments! I‚Äôd love to connect! üí¨

## How to start?

_Do not worry about programming languages. Pick one, and learn it._ You‚Äôll likely not learn only one programming language in your life, but yes, you‚Äôll probably be the best at the first one you choose. For people who want to do web development, I recommend Javascript, ofcourse

But for people who know nothing at all about programming, start with Python. (I know, many will disagree. Leave your points in the comments lol)

My journey started with Python, because it‚Äôs soo easy and I didn‚Äôt want to do _only_ web development, so Python was the best choice for me. After about 1 year of doing python, I dived into Javascript through an educative course. Now I am trying for new low level languages

## What resources and tools should I use?

_Do not worry about tools._ Well, my point is, don‚Äôt get stuck just deciding what to use etc. For code editor, just use VScode. You‚Äôll figure it out as you learn more stuff, but VScode has everything you need.

Resources, though, are important. Here‚Äôs what I used:

- Start with Youtube. Recommended for absolute beginners, but after you know the syntax, and the basic concepts, move on to guides and text-based. Use Youtube on a _need-only_ basis. Youtube tutorials take too much time...
- Guide-Based and Interactive websites - [Educative.io](https://educative.io), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) educative worked the best for me. I got the Educative student pack (from [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack), so I learnt a lot from there for free)
- Reading blogs and tutorial websites on a need basis - If you want to center a div, search it up. In many cases, you‚Äôll get links from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://geeksforgeeks.org), [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/), [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org/) or towardsdatascience. Just read their guides to get your problems solved

## What you should NOT do

### Self taught programming is hard.

Watch this video. It has a lot of DOs and Donts on self taught programming. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBRqYgdL1qo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBRqYgdL1qo)

### The tutorial HELL

I once found myself in ‚ÄúTutorial hell‚Äù ‚Äì I was just following tutorials instead of learning stuff. After the tutorial was complete, I didn‚Äôt know how exactly I made the project. To escape this, I asked myself-

- is it possible for me to make the thing in the tutorial myself?
- Does the tutorial show every line of code (to me, good tutorials should offer a challenge. Show the template of how its done and we have to do it ourselves.)
- is the tutorial unnecessarily long?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - watching tutorials is _FINE! Just make sure you‚Äôre learning stuff from it, without wasting unnecessarily long amounts of time._

There are some youtubers, who really helped me escape the tutorial hell ‚Äì mainly fireship with their short and concise videos [https://youtube.com/fireship](https://youtube.com/fireship). For React, NodeJS and other js related tutorials I think he‚Äôs perfect. \*\*

### Take breaks.

There are some mistakes I did, like coding too much sometimes- and ending up in a burnout, Not completing many of my projects because of procrastination and just ‚Ä¶ having too many projects

### DO MANY PROJECTS!

At some point, I almost gave up on programming because I didn‚Äôt have anything to code. I thought I‚Äôm already good at it, but had no projects. I started making a discord bot, which was a HUGE project for me, as I learnt about APIs, async programming, and so, so much more. Luckily for me, Spacebot blew up (well, kinda. for someone who‚Äôs just started to code, it was a milestone).

This also motivated me to make my own APIs - so basically a chain reaction.

## And finally, READ and WRITE!

Read blogs, and document your journey.

I benefited a lot from reading blogs here on dev.to. They motivate me, and make me aware of what‚Äôs going on. I also benefited a LOT from getting the [daily.dev](http://daily.dev) extension.

I think I started documenting my stuff pretty late, but I‚Äôm glad I did. Write here on dev.to. And then make your own blog as a side-project. [Here‚Äôs a post I wrote that will help you get started](https://dev.to/dhravya/how-i-got-100-followers-on-devto-in-10-days-and-why-you-should-start-blogging-now-362b). One day, one of your blogs will randomly get into the algorithm, but don‚Äôt write for the numbers, write for yourself.

Write tutorials, write about stuff you made. Just write, every week.

Don‚Äôt stress it out. Programming is both, the easiest and hardest things to do at the same time.

## You will never learn it all

One common thing that I think all developers face is that ‚ÄúI need to learn it all‚Äù. ‚ÄúOMG I have so much to learn!‚Äù. But the sad truth is, _You will never learn it all_. You‚Äôll always get the imposter syndrome, it‚Äôs fine. Happens to the best of us.

Disclaimer: Note that its meant for beginners and many of them get stuck just choosing stuff. I‚Äôve just helped them decide faster. Also, none of the links are affiliated and all are just recommended because I learnt through them.
