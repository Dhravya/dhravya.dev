It's been a couple months since I've dived deep into web development, and after some amazing projects like [Tweets.beauty](https://tweets.beauty), [LMFAO.tech](https://lmfao.tech) and many more, I've realised that the best way to learn web development, is to learn React. In terms of framework, I don't think there's anything close to how powerful NextJS is. So here's a collection of resources I used, to learn React and NextJS.

I'll only point out resources that are free, or you can get them for free.

I'll walk over how I did it, but I'll also point out what the best way would have been.

## Pre requisites

So before starting, you need to make sure you atleast know these basics

### Javascript

A basic understanding of Javascript is essential. Learning javascript would make everything 100x easier for you.

#### Resources - Javascript

I learnt Javascript on [Educative.io](https://educative.io). I had the subscription to the course thanks to the [Github Students pack](https://dhravya.dev/blog/github-students-pack)

so,

- Get the students pack
- Educative.io (Interactive learning)
  - (I did this one) [Build a real-world app from scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/the-complete-javascript-course-build-a-real-world-app-from-scratch) (20 hours)
  - (This also seems good, react-focused) [JavaScript Fundamentals Before Learning React](https://www.educative.io/courses/javascript-fundamentals-before-learning-react) (3 hours)

I later also found this course on Scrimba, which also seems to be REALLY good. [Learn Javascript for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)

But well, javascript is an insanely weird language. you MUST know typescript too. But that's not an issue for now - you can switch to typescript slowly.

### HTML

HTML is a very basic language. It's not a programming language. It's just a markup language. Anyone can learn HTML in a couple of hours.

[Here, a really cool interactive HTML cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/)

Honestly, this is all you'll need to know

#### Resources - HTML

For HTML, one of the best resources is [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

## React

Ok, now it gets exciting! You've already learnt a lot of Javascript and HTML - and now you want to learn React.

I learnt react (mostly) on youtube. When I searched for "react tutorial", I found a lot of videos - but ugh, many of them were too long.

### Resources - React

The best video that also helped me was [this one by traversy media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)

- Scrimba also has an amazing react tutorial which my friends used - [Learn react for free | Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). Scrimba is fully interactive, it's a really good resource and also free! In fact, it's so good that it provides the editor and video in the same website side-by-side!
- [CodeDamn](https://codedamn.com/) also has an amazing [react tutorial](https://codedamn.com/learn/reactjs) - Also fully interactive! It also has a youtube video if you don't want to bother with the website.
- If you _don't_ mind paying a little bit, I've heard good things about [UI.dev](https://ui.dev/)'s react tutorial.
- I also didn't know that the new react beta docs also have a tutorial - Which is honestly really good [React Beta docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)

## NextJS

For NextJS, once you're good with react, there's literally no better way to learn it than to go through the [Next.js learn](https://nextjs.org/learn).

It's documented really well and is also sort of interactive, as you're building a blog website and learn things along the way.

I also love [This video by CodeDamn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt3PUvhOVzo) but it's outdated now

## TailwindCSS

For tailwindcss, I'd say, it's very easy to learn. It's just about using little classes to style your components.

Tailwindcss Docs - [Tailwindcss Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) were very helpful to me. The [tailwindcss youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tailwindlabs) is also really really good for learning little tricks and tricks.

If you like learning from videos, this video, again by traversy media is a really good quick tutorial [Tailwind CSS Crash course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBOj6rqRUME)

# Conclusion

That's it! I hope you've learnt a lot now. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
