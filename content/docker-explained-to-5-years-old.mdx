When I was starting out with docker, everything was really difficult for me to figure out. But don't worry. I'm here üòâ

Docker is an AMAZING tool that you just can't miss. It's EVERYWHERE! ![Docker everywhere](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wi6tkhrald0cdt3kwd4f.png)

So here's everything you need to know about docker, in ONE blog. Don't worry - I'll keep it very short and concise ‚ö° I'll walk you through the concepts - Containers, Images, etc. And then we'll write our own `Dockerfile` to containerize a very simple python application!

### What is docker? <a name="what-is-docker"></a>

Docker is a way to _containerize_ applications (putting code in boxes that can work on their own). It magically makes a virtual computer, but guess what - they aren't really virtual computers.

Containers are boxes that have no host Operating system, so they are independent of the device they run on.

Think of it like this - there's a bee that only likes to live in it's own honeycomb, and will not be able to work if it lives somewhere else. You just trap the bee in a box that looks and feels exactly like it's honeycomb. That's containerization.

Containers are made using `Images`

### Docker Images <a name="images"></a>

Docker Images are like templates - a craftbook that _has everything to make the craft_. Or, in other words, it contains a set of instructions for creating a container.

But how do you make these images (to later make containers) ?

This is done using Dockerfiles.

### All about Dockerfiles <a name="dockerfiles"></a>

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Ok, let's make a Dockerfile together.

Now, we'll start with docker HANDS ON!

Quickly download docker on your device : https://www.docker.com/get-started

Now that you have it, let's write a simple flask application and containerize it!

Here's a very simple and minimal flask app ![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2uk8n8f7n3ymvpvm0n42.png)

Now, even though this might be very basic, it actually needs a lot of things to run:

- Python 3.9
- Flask (running `pip install flask`)
- exposure to port 5000

Some programs might only run on specific Operating systems - like Windows-only or Linux-only stuff.

All these problems are solved by writing a simple dockerfile, that sets up a docker image for us. So you need to make a file called `Dockerfile` (exactly, without any file extension)

Here is a walkthrough:

- use FROM to use python base image
- use COPY to copy the app.py file into the container
- use RUN to pip install flask
- use CMD to run "python app.py" when container starts

Its as easy as that!!! ![Dockerfile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9my36kkqeygulzip6ukb.png)

> minor correction : the file should be named Dockerfile instead

### Building the image and running container <a name="container"></a>

Now, build to docker image using the `docker build` command and then run the image by using the `docker run .` command.

You can also use the `--tag` to give a name to the image and make it easier for yourself to run later

```
docker build --tag flask .
docker run --name flask -p 5000:5000 flask
```

Here, `--name` is the name of the container to be run (which i'm naming flask), -p sets the port of the docker CONTAINER to your machine, so you can see your app on `localhost`. Finally, the `flask` at the name is the name of the image to be run.

### More commands <a name="commands"></a>

That's pretty much it!!! use the "docker ps" command to get a list of running containers, "docker ps -a" to get list of ALL containers "docker images" to get list of images

"docker --help" to get list of all commands

Mess around with the commands, they are self-explanatory
