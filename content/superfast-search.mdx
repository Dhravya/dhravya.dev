Today, I spent most of my time updating this blog, and thought to add more features like _search_, _tags_, MDX support, and a few design changes, including the sidebar.

I was deciding how I would implement the search function, because the only time I have done it, was using a Self hosted version of <a data-tip="Typesense is a modern, privacy-friendly, open source search engine built from the ground up using cutting-edge search algorithms, that take advantage of the latest advances in hardware capabilities." href="https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html" class="">Typesense</a>

But well, that was costly to host server-side, especially for something as simple as a blog. and their hosted solutions aren't that great price-wise either.

So one thing was sure, there is no need to use any API for this. After a quick google search, I came across this documentation on Gatsby's website which is about <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-search/">Adding Search to Gatsby</a>

From that guide, under the `Client Side` section, here's what they recommend:

<div>
  <code>
It is possible to do all the work in your Gatsby site without needing a third-party solution. This involves writing a bit of code, but using less services. With large amounts of content to index, it can also increase the bundle size significantly.

One way of doing this is to use the js-search library:

[Adding Search with JS Search](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-search-with-js-search)

There are two Gatsby plugins that support this as well:

`gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search` `gatsby-plugin-local-search`

  </code>
</div>

Now these search methods index everything which means higher bundle size. And they are also a hassle to set up.

## The solution I went with <a id='solution'></a>

Now for my use case, it was probably a good idea to just make something simple by myself, and I can build on it as I keep updating this blog.

The idea is really simple, I just need to make a search box, and on every keystroke, loop through the contents and filter them like that.

```jsx
const BlogIndex = ({ data, location }) => {
  // These posts can be anything,
  // I've just used the posts from a gatsby query
	const posts = data.allMdx.edges;

  // We need to filter the posts by the search query.
  // by default, we have all posts
	const [filteredPosts, setFilteredPosts] = useState(posts);

  // This will be the search query
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Our search bar */}
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search"
        onChange={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          setSearch(e.target.value)}
      }/>

      {/* Simply mapping through everything and rendering blogs */}
      {filteredPosts.map(({ node }) => {
        <BlogPost post={node} key={node.id} />
      }}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, whenever something is typed in the box, the `search` state will be updated. Now, let's write a `useEffect` hook to update the `filteredPosts` state whenever the `search` state changes.

```jsx
const BlogIndex = ({ data, location }) => {

	const posts = data.allMdx.edges;
	const [filteredPosts, setFilteredPosts] = useState(posts);
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

  //highlight-start
  useEffect(() => {
    if (search) {
      // post filtering here
    }
  }
  // only update the filteredPosts state when the search state changes or the posts state changes
  , [search, posts]);
  ///highlight-end

  return (
    ... // rest of the code
  )
```

And now let's write some very simple code to filter the posts.

```jsx
...

  if (search) {
    const filteredPosts = posts.filter(post => {
        //highlight-start
        const title = post.title.toLowerCase();
        const description = post.description.toLowerCase();
        return title.match(search.toLowerCase()) || description.match(search.toLowerCase());
        //highlight-end
    }
  }
  setFilteredPosts(filteredPosts);
...
```

Since my blog has tags and stuff like that, I added functionality to search and filter by tags, too

```jsx
    if (search.startsWith("#")) {
      return tags.includes(search.replace("#", ""));
    }
...
```

And that's it! But wait, there's more. This works, but you can't really _share_ a search query to someone else, I can share google links - [google.com/search?q=github](https://google.com/search?q=github) I think that's kinda important, like, for times when I have to share [all my Rust blogs](/?q=#rust), it's just easier and convenient.

so well, let's update the URL to include the search query, in real time! I hadn't ever done this before, so it was great learning it. I got the inspiration from the <a data-tip="<img width=600 src='https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/l2z2r69z30a.gif'></img>" href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT search engine</a> (Hover over the link to see the gif, notice how the URL changes in real time)

I found out about the `window.history.pushState()` method, which basically allows you to push a new URL without adding it to the browser history, or reloading the page. Read the documentation for the same over here -

<a
  data-tip="<img width=700 src='https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/l2z32l9dj0a.png'></img>"
  href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API'
>
  History API | MDN
</a>

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
		if (search) {
      //highlight-start
			if (window.history.pushState) {
        window.history.pushState(null, null, `/?q=${search}`);
      }
      //highlight-end
      const filteredPosts = posts.filter(post => {
        const title = post.title.toLowerCase();
        const description = post.description.toLowerCase();
        return title.match(search.toLowerCase()) || description.match(search.toLowerCase());
    }
  }
  setFilteredPosts(filteredPosts);
  }, [search]);
```

And now, we also need to parse the _original_ request, using the `window location ` object, and make it default for the `useState` hook we made for `search`

```jsx
                      // üëáüèª converts the URL from HTML encoded to a string (%20 to space)
	const initialState = decodeURI(location.href? // Use window location
                      .split('/')               // Split the URL into an array
                      .pop()                    // Get the last element only
                      .split("=")               // at this point, it's q=search, so we only need the "Search" parth
                      .pop() );

                                        // üëáüèª We're using the initialState to set the search query.
  const [search, setSearch] = useState(initialState); // Now, only the blogs that match the query will be displayed on first load
```

## That's it!
