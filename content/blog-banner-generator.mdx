title: I was tired of making banners for my blogs, so I automated it
summary: I'm a very lazy person, and always procrastinate on the smallest of things - opening the image editor, and making a good blog banner would always be the "extra" thing I had to do every time I wrote something. So, I made a script that generates them for me in milliseconds!

I'm a very lazy person, and always procrastinate on the smallest of things - opening the image editor, and making a good blog banner would always be the "extra" thing I had to do every time I wrote something. So, I made a script that generates them for me in milliseconds!

As Bill Gates says,

> always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because he will find an easy way to do it

The output is fully customizable, as it is 100% generated from code. You can change some values here and there, and boom! Generated. I ran it through all the posts of my [blog](https://blog.dhravya.dev) and it quickly replaced many of the blog posts for me.

Check out the code [Here](https://github.com/Dhravya/blog-banner-generator) (And ‚≠ê the post if you liked it!)
